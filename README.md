# Antenna Analyser

A MATLAB App in which various characteristics like Radiation pattern, Impedance plots, Azimuthal patterns, etc. of finite-length antennas such as Vee-dipole, Folded-dipole, cycloid-dipole, etc. antennas are supported. It also covers the widely used Microstrip patch antenna.


## Supported Antennas
- Dipole Antenna
- Folded-Dipole Antenna
- Vee-Dipole Antenna
- Cycloid-Dipole Antenna
- Circular Loop Antenna
- Microstrip Patch Antenna

## Resultant Characteristic Plots

- Show Antenna
- Radiation Pattern
- Azimuth Pattern
- Elevation Pattern
- Electric and Magnetic Fields
- Impedance Plots
- Radiation Efficiency
All the plots with default values can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11QP35GiQJoWTvk9brPBc-FaFTQho1vDH/view?usp=sharing)

# Antenna_Analyser
A MATLAB App in which various characteristics like Radiation pattern, Impedance plots, Azimuthal patterns, etc. of finite-length antennas such as Vee-dipole, Folded-dipole, cycloid-dipole, etc. antennas are supported. It also covers the widely used Microstrip patch antenna.
Note: This app was built in MATLAB R2021b and hence some functions which were introduced in 2021 would give errors in the previous MATLAB versions.
